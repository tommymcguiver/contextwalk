# contextwalk

Ever had issues working out what files are being added to the docker context ? This program uses the same logic to print out which files are included in the context so you can add unneeded files to .dockerignore

## Install

go get github.com/tommymcguiver/contextwalk
go install github.com/tommymcguiver/contextwalk/...
